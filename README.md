This is a programming asssignment to fulfill my machine learning course assignment. 
Similar to the ID3 implementationI used as a  trainig data  the car data  from UCI machine learning repository 
at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation and trained a naive classifeir with 2/3 of the cars
choosen randomly and tested on the rest of the data
